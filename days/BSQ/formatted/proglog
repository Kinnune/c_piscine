find square takes the map

and while our square size is not bigger than the actual map we keep increasing it

we also check if we have exited out the bottom of the map

check to see if the square fits in the map but this should actually be a while loop that keeps incrementing the square each time
it passes the column check function

and when it does not the square that did not pass statrts to travel the matrix

how does the colum check work?

while our temporary y aka the lines we have moved down is less than the dimention of the square

we keep moving on the x axis untill we hit a block character in wich case we return 0

or we satisfy the specified length of the square and move down a line and increment temp y

when we reach temp y reaches the size of the square to check and we also have confirmed the last x axis we can return succes as the square 
did not get blocked
